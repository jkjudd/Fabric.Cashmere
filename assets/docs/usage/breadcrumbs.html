<h5>Router Setup</h5>
<p>The <code>hc-breadcrumb</code> component makes use of the angular <code>Router</code> with the scope of the routing module in which it is placed. A custom data element named <code>breadcrumb</code> must be added to its Routes in order for the breadcrumb component to function properly. Below in an example of a properly configured Route:</p>
<pre><code class="language-json">{
    path: &quot;breadcrumbs&quot;,
    component: BreadcrumbsDemoComponent,
    data: {breadcrumb: &quot;Home Page&quot;},
    children: [
        {
            path: &quot;breadcrumb1&quot;,
            component: Breadcrumb1DemoComponent,
            data: {breadcrumb: &quot;Second Page&quot;}
        }
    ]
}
</code></pre>
